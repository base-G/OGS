Installation instructions for the Windows platform
---------------------------------------------------
(Note: this could go in the main INSTALL file)

The instructions are rather long; they detail what I had to go through
install libdc1394. It's not very difficult though. If you have
problems or comments about these instructions, please contact the
mailing list libdc1394-devel@lists.sf.net. The mailing list is
private, but you can send messages even if you are not a member; you
will just have to wait for moderation on your first message.


0. Unplug all 1394 cameras on your system.

Windows tries to be smart but more often than not it isn't. Don't give
it something to chew on ;)



1. Install MinGW and Msys

Use the project's installer to install both MinGW and Msys
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/mingw-get/



2. CMU driver installation

This windows version of libdc1394 uses the CMU 1394 driver at its
core. For this reason you should first download and install this
driver.

** Attention: if you have a Point Grey driver installed on your
   computer (FlyCapture,...), you should first remove it
   thouroughly. Verify after its removal that the camera is not
   recognized as a Point Grey camera anymore, but as an "Imaging
   Device" (in the device manager). Any attempt to use the CMU driver
   and/or libdc1394 will fail if Windows is still complaining about
   the missing "pgrcam.sys" file, among others. Verify that no file in
   windows/inf/ refers to pgrcam.sys and check the following
   directories for PGR files: /Windows/System32/drivers,
   /Windows/System32/DRVSTORE and /Windows/System32/ReinstallBackups.
   Editing the registry may be necessary too (augh!).

Get the CMU driver at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~iwan/1394/
We recommend you use the installer "1394camera646-unsigned.exe", as
this is the version on which this library is based.

After the installer has run, you may need to tell Windows to use the
CMU driver. Plug a camera, verify that the CMU demo app sees it and
that you can get a live feed. If not, go to the hardware manager and
check the driver status of your camera. If drivers are not attached to
it, you must use the "have disk" option and point Windows to the
location of the INF file, normally c:\Program Files\CMU\1394Camera
\Driver. Don't let Windows look for drivers on its own. After you have
confirmed that the drivers used by the camera are the CMU drivers,
re-test using the CMU demo app.

Note 1: in the CMU demo app, you need to reset the camera before you
can control it.
Note 2: the CMU app sometimes fails to start a Format_7 stream. I
recommend that you start by selecting a standard video mode
(e.g. 640x480 MONO)
Note 3: on 64bit systems, the CMU driver is installed in c:\Program
Files (x86)\CMU\1394Camera\Driver (note the extra "(x86)")

Once the CMU stuff is working fine, run the Msys shell and copy the
library files and headers to your mingw system:

cp /Program\ Files/CMU/1394Camera/lib/1394camera.lib /mingw/lib/lib1394camera.a
cp /Program\ Files/CMU/1394Camera/include/1394camapi.h /mingw/include/
cp /Program\ Files/CMU/1394Camera/include/1394common.h /mingw/include/

Tip 1: Use slashes ("/") when working in Msys, not backslashes ("\")
Tip 2: Installation should be done in the /mingw directory, NOT the
msys directory.



3. SDL installation (optional)

A new example program is being used to test the windows platform:
dc1394_iso. This program requires SDL, so if you want to compile it
you should install SDL first.

Get SDL at http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14.tar.gz
Don't use 1.2.15, the files are buggy (this may have been fixed
recently). Put the tarball in your Msys home, usually something like
c:/mingw/msys/1.0/home/<username>/

tar -xvzf SDL-1.2.14.tar.gz
cd SDL-1.2.14
./configure --prefix=/mingw/
make
make install



4. libdc1394 (at last!)

If you reed this, you already have the tarball or GIT snapshot. Put it
alongside the SDL library in your Msys home directory (see above), and
again:

tar -xvzf libdc1394.tar.gz
cd libdc1394
./configure --prefix=/mingw/
make
make install

To test the library, run dc1394_iso.exe. If your camera does not
support the modes hardcoded in that example, you may need to adjust
some #define statements in dc1394_iso.c

Note: when using Msys, stderr is not dumped on the terminal but in a
file. If you run the example from the directory of its location, the
output file should be ./.libs/stderr.txt

If you get a nice live video, congratulations! If not, please contact
the mailing list (libdc1394-devel@lists.sf.net).
